------------------------------ Observer Design Pattern ------------------------------

Problem Statement:
We need to fire an event/notification/alert when an enetity's state changes. Example: Notify Me alert when a product comes 'in stock' or Notify users when Virat Kholi posts something.

Hints:
There will always be 2 things in the question:
    1.) Observable
    2.) Observer

Solution:
We will define two seperate entities 'Observable' & 'Observer'. Observable will be maintaining a list of Observers, so whenever an event occurs we will call notify/alert method of all the Observers of a particular Observable.
